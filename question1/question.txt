Question 1. Polymorphism in Go [4 points]

Go is not an object-oriented language but it is still possible to implement polymorphism and to define
methods associated to types.

You will find with this assignment, a set of Java classes representing a hierarchy of classes. You are
asked to translate this program into Go. Your Go program must also implement polymorphism among
all types of employees. It must also produce the same output.

You must also adhere to the following guidelines:
• All employees created in main function must be in an array of StaffMember type.
• Java References should be replaced by Go pointers
• You must use the constructor pattern in Go that consists in defining a NewThing(parameters...)

function instead of the new Thing(parameters...) call to constructor used in Java
• To replace Java inheritance, you must use type embedding
• Polymorphism must be implemented using Go interfaces
